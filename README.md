Front-end task

Create a simple CRUD application using technology you feel most comfortable with.
The app needs to be simple, have a view where all the items are displayed (new, edit
and delete button), and a view to create/edit the items.
You don't have to create the API, mock it on the front end, without using external
libraries or services.
There should be a sidebar that contains links to other pages.
Items should be displayed as cards.
Try not to use any UI libraries and the app should be responsive



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
